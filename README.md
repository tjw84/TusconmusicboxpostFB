# Overview

This is a basic NodeJS project that uses tables to show and sort data related to Firearms that is linked to a DynomoDB database
You will need to create a .aws folder under your user name with a credentials file (not a .txt file) to hold the credentials to access the correct DynomoDB database (for obvious reasons I am not giving you access to mine).
